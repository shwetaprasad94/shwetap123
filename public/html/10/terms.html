    <h1>Terms</h1>
    <h2>Plugins</h2>
    <p>Easy to implement with limited customization</p>
    
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>Facebox social plugins.  We added a Like plugin (iframe), with only three layout options.  Has access to public info only (Friends list).</p>
    
    <h2>API</h2>
    <p>API is the direct library that accesses a web site. Rich customization but more difficult to learn.  Private content is accessible thru authentication.</p>
    
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>Facebook API.  We can read more private information after user grants permission</p>
    
    <h2>Abstraction layer</h2>
    <p>Is a broad library that accesses multiple services or sites.  Similar learning curve to API and slightly less customization</p>
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>Mapstraction: Allows us to change mapping providers without altering our code.  The library has more general features common across all the mapping providers.</p>
